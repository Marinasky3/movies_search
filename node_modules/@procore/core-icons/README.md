# Updating Icons from IcoMoon (Deprecated)

~~## Updating in [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)~~

~~1. Name icons according to the following naming convention:~~

```
tool-?[name]-[shape]-[o]-[direction]
```

~~2. Select the entire font set and select "Generate Font"~~

~~3. Download the font archive~~

~~4. If icons have not yet been updated in the current prerelease, the `src/selection-old.json` file must be replaced with the `src/selection.json`. Otherwise nothing needs to be done on this step.~~

~~5. Extract the downloaded font archive contents into the `src` folder, overwriting the existing files.~~

~~6. Check on localhost that the icons appear on the Icons docs~~
