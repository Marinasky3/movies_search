 * @deprecated The `Icon` component has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
 *
 * We recommend using the React components directly from the `@procore/core-icons/dist` package.
 *
 * These new icons can be tree-shaked and are sourced directly from Figma.
 *
 * `import { ChevronRight } from '@procore/core-icons/dist'`
 *
 * `() => <Button icon={<ChevronRight />} />`
 *
 * * In addition to this, components that accept an `icon` prop as a string now accept a `ReactNode` too,
 * and the string APIs have been deprecated.
